    "**Answer: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Logistic Regression : Logistic regression is a common analysis tool used for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) when the response variable of interest is qualitative for example disease/normal, Blood group A/B/AB/O etc. It comes as one of the standard tools in most GWAS packages (e.g. PLINK).\n",
    "    - Strength of logistic regression is that Logistic regression models are easy to interpret and can be implemented on large number of features and is fast and reliable when the dimension gets large. Additionally  there are lots of techniques developed to do subset selection or stepwise feature selection. It also lends itself to regularization which can help to decrease overfitting. It provides a probabilistic prediction as to the maximum likelihood of prediction of one category vs another.\n",
    "    - Weakness of the model is that large sample sizes are required for logistic regression to provide similar numbers in each categories of the response variable, and performance is poor when number of samples are not equally represented between categories. The more features, the larger the sample size required to obtain generalizable results. Ultimately logistic regression is still a linear classifier and though more complex exponents can be added to the features, it is limited in modelling highly complex non linear relationships between features and the response variable. Can only work with numerical data, and so categorical data needs to be converted to numeric with one-hot encoding.\n",
    "    - logistic regression analysis is based on calculating the odds of not graduating i.e. the ratio of the probability of not graduating divided by the probability of graduating, which is perfect for this problem. Also since there are a comparable number of students likely to graduate and number of students not likely to graduate, a reasonable logistic model can be built. As the number of features are large logistic regression is helpful. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Decision Trees: Decision trees work by segmenting the feature space into hyper-rectangles in high dimensions. Real world use of tree based classification for drug analysis in Pharmacology  https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/119068\n",
    "    - Decision tree models are particularly useful with prediction with small number of features, and leads to a clearly visializable decision flow, which is very intuitive for human understanding. Can work with both numerical or categorical data, and doesnt necessarily need one hot encoding, and very little data preparation. It is very fast when the number of features are small.\n",
    "    - Weakness of decision tree models, is that very complex trees can be constructed making them very prone to overfitting since they have high degrees of freedom. Decision boundaries are parallel to the axes, for each pair of features, and so a large number of boundaries are needed to fit complex relationships. \n",
    "    - It is useful in modeling this data, as it creates an easy to interpret tree, and since this data is a combination of categorical and numerical features, the model will be easy to build into a tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Support Vector Machines : SVMs are yet another supervised learning methods which can be used for classification, the essence of which is to maximize the margins around the discriminant hyperplane. A real world application of SVM is seen in Financial time series prediction http://www.svms.org/finance/VanGestel-etal2001.pdf\n",
    "    - Strengths of SVMs are that : SVMs are quiet versatile as domain knowledge can be introduced into the model by carefully designing Kernels. Regularization parameters allow for preventing overfitting of SVM models. Effective in complex high dimensional spaces. Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (support vectors), so it is also memory efficient, and since SVM is using the points along the seperation boundary, it is less sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "    - If the number of features are larger than the number of observations, then it is also prone to overfitting. Choice of the kernel is a key determinant as to the effectiveness of the model, depending on the choice of kernel, it could result in both high bias as well as high variance models. SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "    - SVMs may be a good choice in this classification problem, as there are a sizable number of observations to be able to build generalizable SVM models, and the number of features seems to be smaller than the number of observations thus making it less prone to overfitting.\n",

This suggests that the tuned model which has a C=0.01, has a regularization, which prevents overfitting of the model as suggested by the fact that the F1score of the new model on the training set went down. And also the model is more generalizable now as the F1score on the test set improved.**"
